# ⚖️ Resources

**Resource Production and Consumption**

The gameplay in "MountainSea" revolves around opening sessions similar to launching instances, where players can engage in "in-session" exploration, development, and combat. After a session ends, there are settlement rewards, and players return to the game lobby, referred to as "out-session," for item purchases, social interactions, and character development.
