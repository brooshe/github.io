# 📖 Introduction

Over thousands of years, the world has transitioned from the brink of chaos back to order. The Jianmu tree (Live Tree）, rooted deeply between heaven and earth, has stabilized the fragmented small worlds, becoming a symbol of the new order in the MountainSea universe. Although the divine war is now an ancient memory, its aftermath still casts a shadow over the world like a lingering mist.&#x20;

"MountainSea" is an action survival adventure game developed by a renowned multiplayer action game team using Unreal Engine 4. Set in an ancient Oriental mythical world, the game offers a high degree of freedom akin to "Valheim" and "7 Days to Die." It is an open-world survival game that integrates survival and construction mechanisms, cross-platform multiplayer cooperation, city defense building, character development, and beast tide defense. The game blends an Oriental fantasy style with rich Chinese elements, allowing players to immerse themselves in a mysterious and ancient world and enjoy an enthralling journey through "MountainSea."

In **MountainSea**, players can immerse themselves in rich resource collection and construction gameplay. Players gather resources by harvesting or defeating mythical beasts and use these precious materials to craft and enhance equipment. The equipment features randomly generated attributes, requiring players to continually play and collect rare materials to upgrade their gear. This system reflects the wisdom and creativity of Oriental mythology, offering players a deep and engaging experience as they explore and build within this mythical world.
