# ü§ù Multiplayer

##

In multiplayer mode, you can divide up the work of exploring the map, as well as allocating resources and rewards to the more appropriate players. In multiplayer games, there is a need for C players who specialize in personal development and combat, as well as players who give up the efficiency of their own development and focus on tower defense construction. The division of labor between the main and secondary play styles enriches the experience and allows for a better acceptance of players with different needs.
