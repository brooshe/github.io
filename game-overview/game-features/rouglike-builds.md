The platform section is designed with a talent tree system, where players can choose their own branches to build according to the talent points they have. Players need to accumulate talent points through constant battles within a season.

## Skill System

Players exploring within a single game will be randomly rewarded with a triple-choice of feats, with multi-directional mechanics and attribute enhancements to the player's skills, which players can choose from according to their own strategies

## Runes

Players exploring within a single game are rewarded with a triple choice of runes, granting players additional passive abilities. Due to the limited number of rune slots, players will need to constantly choose between runes of various qualities and abilities to best suit their needs.

At the same time, runes can be synthesized, refined, and recast, and unused runes have a chance to be transformed into suitable runes for the player; thus reducing the player's frustration in collecting runes and motivating them to keep collecting.
