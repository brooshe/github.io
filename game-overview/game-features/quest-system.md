**合作任务**：《山海》设计了一系列需要多人协作完成的任务，如通过不同的技能搭配抵御Boss、分工协作强化城防建设等。

Cooperative Quests: The Moutainseas has designed a series of quests that require multi-player collaboration, such as fending off bosses through different skill combinations, dividing up the work to strengthen the construction of city defenses, and so on.

**日常任务**：除此之外，《山海》也为玩家提供每日、每周的日常任务，如收集资源、完成特定地点的任务、参加活动等。这些任务可以提供稳定的回报，是玩家在局外最重要的资源收集手段。

Daily Quests: In addition to this, the Moutainseas also provides players with daily and weekly daily quests, such as collecting resources, completing quests in specific locations, and participating in events. These tasks can provide stable returns and are the most important means for players to collect resources outside of the game.

**个人任务**：除了团队任务外，还有丰富而独特的个人任务，你的角色在《山海》有着一个丰富的故事背景，你将在完成任务的过程中逐步解锁游戏的故事情节和世界观，体验角色的逐步成长。

Individual Quests: In addition to team quests, there are also rich and unique individual quests. Your character in the Moutainseas has a rich story background, and you will gradually unlock the game's storyline and worldview as you complete the quests, experiencing the gradual growth of your character.

**赛季任务**：《山海》的每个赛季都会包含限时的特别任务；赛季循环：新赛季新玩点，赛季迭代以“新体验、新玩法”为核心，而不仅仅是数值和难度的重置。

Season Quests: Each season of the Moutainseas  includes special quests for a limited period of time; Season Cycle: New Season, New Play Points, Season Iteration is centered on “new experience, new gameplay” rather than just a reset of values and difficulty.
