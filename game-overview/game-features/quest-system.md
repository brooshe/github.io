**Cooperative Quests**:&#x20;

The Moutainseas has designed a series of quests that require multi-player collaboration, such as fending off bosses through different skill combinations, dividing up the work to strengthen the construction of city defenses, and so on.



**Daily Quests**:&#x20;

In addition to this, the Moutainseas also provides players with daily and weekly daily quests, such as collecting resources, completing quests in specific locations, and participating in events. These tasks can provide stable returns and are the most important means for players to collect resources outside of the game.



**Individual Quests:**&#x20;

In addition to team quests, there are also rich and unique individual quests. Your character in the Moutainseas has a rich story background, and you will gradually unlock the game's storyline and worldview as you complete the quests, experiencing the gradual growth of your character.



**Season Quests:**&#x20;

Each season of the Moutainseas  includes special quests for a limited period of time; Season Cycle: New Season, New Play Points, Season Iteration is centered on ‚Äúnew experience, new gameplay‚Äù rather than just a reset of values and difficulty.
