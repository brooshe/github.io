At nightfall, hidden dangers emerge, with terrifying beast hordes attacking the base and threatening the Live Tree. Players must survive this onslaught and defend against the destruction.&#x20;

This scenario tests not only individual skills but also strategic planning, resource management, and real-time decision-making, akin to traditional survival defense games like "7 Days to Die." Players must devise strategies to handle ever-changing threats with limited resources.
